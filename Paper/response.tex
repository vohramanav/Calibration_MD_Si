\section{Discrepancy with Experiments}
\label{sec:response}

As discussed earlier in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, bulk thermal conductivity estimates using NEMD simulations
severely under-predicted due to reduction in mean free path associated with phonon transport. Additionally, the
introduction of thermostats causes a significant amount of variability in the applied thermal gradient, especially
in their vicinity due to a so-called Kapitza effect. We illustrate this phenomenon by plotting temperature along
the length of the bar in Figure~\ref{fig:kapitza}.
